Important rules:

All text must be bilingual — toggling EN/BN switches every visible string on the page instantly without page reload. Use a simple React context or state for this.
No payment functionality anywhere.
Smooth scroll for all anchor links.
The "Book This Package" buttons must pass the selected package to the booking form via state or URL param.
Keep components clean and well-commented.
Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind utility classes throughout.
